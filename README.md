# WGTestAssignement
Test assignment on Unity UI and stuff

# Current state
* Plugins: Rider, VSCode, YamlDotNet
* Initial assets: UI, hangar, yaml configs, build time asset bundles
* Custom build scripts: asset bundles, project
* Initial data loading from StreamingAssets folder
* Convenient scene loading: somewhat emulates one-level-deep nested prefabs

# To do
* Use WWW.Dispose()
* Tanks collection yaml config, as opposed to specific tank config
* Hook up yaml plugin and fill UI from configs
