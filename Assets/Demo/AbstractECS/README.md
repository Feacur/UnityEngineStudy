# Summary
Exploring Entity Component System pattern.  

Obvious minuses of current implementation:  
* code first
* no cache-coherency
* enterprise-like abstract verbosity
* boilerplate __code__ inside __data__ components

# How to work with this stuff
Use scene "Scenes/Main.unity"  

# Entity Component System
Basic elements:  
* Entity - a set of components
* Component - some data, state, trait
* System - specific logic for engine or game
